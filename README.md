# my master thesis about reservoir computing in networks of coupled stuart landau oscillators coupled in a complex network of delay lines.
The thesis was submitted in 2020.

This repository was originally used to write my thesis step by step. But in the end I wrote everything on my laptop which made pushing and pulling from different locations unneccessary.
In the end this repository was simply updated to include the final version of the projectfiles as well as just the final pdf-file of the thesis I submitted.
