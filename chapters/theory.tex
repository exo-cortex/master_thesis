	\subsection{Stuart-Landau-Oscillator}
	The Stuart-Landau oscillator is a dynamical system often used to model basic class 1 lasers. It can be written either as a single complex differential equation (\ref{eq:stuartlandauequation}) or a set of two equations written in polar coordinates (\ref{eq:stuartlandauequation_polar}). From the equation in polar coordinates easy to see that the equation has rotational symmetry as the radial differential equation does not change with the dynamical variable $\phi$.
	
	\begin{equation}	
		\dot{z} = (\lambda +  i \omega + \gamma |z|^2 ) \; z
		\label{eq:stuartlandauequation}		
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
		\dot{r} & = \lambda r + \operatorname{Re} (\gamma) \; r^{3} \\
		\dot{\phi} &= i \omega + \operatorname{Im}(\gamma) \; r^{2} 
		\end{split}
		\label{eq:stuartlandauequation_polar}
	\end{equation}

	For the radial dynamical variable the Stuart-Landau oscillator has two fixed points where the derivative $\dot{r}$ vanishes $r = 0$ and $r = \sqrt{-\lambda /\operatorname{Re}(\gamma)}$ whose stability depends on $\lambda$ and $\operatorname{Re}(\gamma)$. For $\operatorname{Re}(\gamma) < 0 $ (supercritical case).

The limit cycle (LC) which is shown in fig \ref{fig:stuart_spiral} is depending on the ratio or $\lambda$ and $Re \left[\gamma \right]$.





As can be seen in (eq. \ref{eq:stuartlandauequation}), the equation has a linear and a nonlinear term regarding the absolute value of $z$.

    A circulant matrix has the same entries its row vectors, but with its entries rotated one element to the right relative to the previous row.
    
\subsection{virtual Nodes and multiplexing}
	here: papers for explanation!
	By multiplexing the input signal one can create virtual nodes in a network. The analogy to a real network can be best understood if the input signal is masked with a binary mask containing only values of either $0$ or $1$. 
	
	here add dependency of total linear memory on number of nodes and virtal nodes.
