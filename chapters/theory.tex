	\subsection{Stuart-Landau-Oscillator}
	The Stuart-Landau oscillator is a dynamical system often used to model basic class 1 lasers.
	
	\begin{equation}	
		\dot{z}(t) = (\lambda +  i \omega + \gamma |z(t)|^2 ) z(t)
		\label{eq:stuartlandauequation}		
	\end{equation}

As can be seen in (eq. \ref{eq:stuartlandauequation}), the equation has a linear and a nonlinear term regarding the absolute value of $z$.

	\subsubsection{circulant Matrix}
    A circulant matrix has the same entries its row vectors, but with its entries rotated one element to the right relative to the previous row.
    
\subsection{virtual Nodes and multiplexing}
	here: papers for explanation!
	By multiplexing the input signal one can create virtual nodes in a network. The analogy to a real network can be best understood if the input signal is masked with a binary mask containing only values of either $0$ or $1$.
